This is a beer centered project with two facets. Primarily, it is a blog about beer. It will also provde endpoints for an API that can be used to access data about the beer that is discussed on the blog.

Aside from reviewing and talking about beer there will be occasional meta posts about creating and working on the API itself.

Hopefully there will also eventually be projects that use the API in various ways. But for now it will mostly consist of me drinking beer. :)
