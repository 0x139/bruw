This is a project based on the consumption and enjoyment of beer. At it's core it is a blog about beer. 

In addition to simply posting pictures of and discussing drinks I will gather into a NoSQL database. 

Eventually I plan on providing endpoints for an API so that other beverage enthusiasts can use the data in any way they see fit.

Hopefully in the future there will be projects that then  use the API in various ways. But for now it will mostly consist of me drinking beer. :)
