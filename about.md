bruw.org is a project built around the consumption of various types of beverages. At it's core it is a blog about beer. Yes I'll write about other beverages; wine and liquor maybe; even coffee! But the bulk of it will be about beer.

And that's not all. This project is a chance for me to learn more about data. All of the beverages I write about in the blog and all of the data associated with those beverages will be accessible through a REST API.

There are many great beer review sites out there and this blog is not intended to replace them. It is only to document my own beverage experiences with the ability to interact with those experiences programatically.

I'm neither a professional brewer nor a software engineer. This is just a learning experience.
