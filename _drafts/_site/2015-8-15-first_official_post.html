<p>Although the site has been up for awhile this is the first official post with pictures and everything.</p>

<p>We’re going to start off by reviewing three different IPAs. Throughout the review I’m going to talk a little bit about how I created the API that ties into this blog and how it can be accessed, both for getting data and inputting your own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finestkind IPA is our salute to the American hop grower, a beer that’s meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that’s not easy to find. Its citrusy hop flavor, pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness, makes this beer very easy to drink.</p>

<h3 id="from-the-company-1">From the company:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Acme IPA is profoundly hoppy, finished with over a pound of fresh whole hops per barrel. The result of this generous hopping is a beer that is deliciously dry, and eminently drinkable in spite of its apparent strength.</p>

<h3 id="from-the-company-2">From the company:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our rad IPA is created from a base of Pale and Crystal malts and aggressively jopped throughout the brewing process. Its caramel mal presence is a nice balance to the high hop bitterness and hop flavor end to end.</p>

<div style="float: right">The first <type>IPA</type> on our list is <beername>Finestkind</beername> by Smuttynose. From what I can tell it's a solid IPA without too much hoppy-ness. The first thing I smelled was orange.<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7uSWNRYY5IuT2ZrajB5UTJhMVE" height="150px" width="150px" /></div>
