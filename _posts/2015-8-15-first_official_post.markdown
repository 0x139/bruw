#IPAs & APIs

##First Offical Post

Although the site has been up for awhile this is the first official post with pictures and everything.

We're going to start off by reviewing three different IPAs. Through the review I'm going to talk a little bit about how I created the API that ties into this blog and how it can be accessed, both for getting data and inputting your own.

###The Three IPAs:

####Smuttynose Finestkind IPA

###From the company:
>Finestkind IPA is our salute to the American hop grower, a beer taht's meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. Its citrusy hop flavor, pleasantly balanced bya smooth bitterness, makes this veer very easy to drink.

From what I can tell it's a solid IPA without too much hoppy-ness. The first thing I smelled was orange.

Now we're testing the beer called <beername>Hopdevil</beername>. It's an <type>IPA</type>. It's a strong beer with an ABV of <abv>9.8</abv>%.
