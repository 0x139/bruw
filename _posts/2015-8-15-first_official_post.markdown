#IPAs & APIs

Although the site has been up for a while now this is the first official post. With pictures and everything!

I'll start off by reviewing three different IPAs: Finestkind by Smuttynose, Acme by Northcoast, and Nectar by Humboldt.

Throughout the review I'll also talk a little bit about the API that ties into this blog and how it can be accessed, both for getting data and inputting your own.

##The Three IPAs:

####Smuttynose Finestkind IPA

###From the company:
>Finestkind IPA is our salute to the American hop grower, a beer that's meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. Its citrusy hop flavor, pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness, makes this beer very easy to drink.

####Nortchoast Brewing Acme IPA

###From the company:
>Acme IPA is profoundly hoppy, finished with over a pound of fresh whole hops per barrel. The result of this generous hopping is a beer that is deliciously dry, and eminently drinkable in spite of its apparent strength.

###Humboldt Brewing Co. Nectar IPA

###From the company:
>Our rad IPA is created from a base of Pale and Crystal malts and aggressively jopped throughout the brewing process. Its caramel mal presence is a nice balance to the high hop bitterness and hop flavor end to end.

##First Impressions
<p></p>

####Finestkind

<div style="float: left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7uSWNRYY5IuT2NDMUhLelBrNzA" style="margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px"></div> <p>The first <type>IPA</type> on our list is <beername>Finestkind</beername> by Smuttynose. From what I can tell it's a solid IPA without too much hoppy-ness. The first thing I smelled was orange. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

####Nectar

<div style="float: left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7uSWNRYY5IuN2wtVzNmWm9PMlk" style="margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px"></div><p> The next <type>IPA</type> is the <beername>Nectar IPA</beername> by Humboldt Brewing Co. It's got an ABV of <abv>6.7</abv>% with 60 IBUs. The first impression I got when I smelled it was of oranges. The first time I tried it I couldn't quite put my finger on the taste. It was definitely sweet, almost like a candy. On the second time through I finally realized: orange flintstone vitamins.</p>
<p>This was my favorite of all three IPAs. Typically when I taste a citrus flavored IPA it is almost awlays of grapefruit, so it's a nice change of pace</p>

####Acme

<div style="float: left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7uSWNRYY5IuN2wtVzNmWm9PMlk" style="margin: 10px 10px 0px 0px"></div><p> The next <type>IPA</type> is the <beername>Nectar IPA</beername> by Humboldt Brewing Co. It's got an ABV of <abv>6.7</abv>% with 60 IBUs. The first impression I got when I smelled it was of oranges. The first time I tried it I couldn't quite put my finger on the taste. It was definitely sweet, almost like a candy. On the second time through I finally realized: orange flintstone vitamins.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to switch gears and go into the API for a minute or so. If you don't care about the tech stuff then you can <a href="#beer-fragment">skip ahead </a> to the rest of the beer review</p>.

##The API
<p></p>
###RESTful
The API is accessed through typical REST URIs. Here's a quick rundown of what can be accessed at present:

* **http://bruw.org/api/beers**<br />
List all beers in the database

* **http://bruw.org/api/beers/:by_id**<br/>
List a specific beer by ID
