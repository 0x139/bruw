#IPAs & APIs

##First Offical Post

Although the site has been up for awhile this is the first official post with pictures and everything.

We're going to start off by reviewing three different IPAs. Through the review I'm going to talk a little bit about how I created the API that ties into this blog and how it can be accessed, both for getting data and inputting your own.

###The Three IPAs:

####Smuttynose Finestkind IPA

###From the company:
>Strike gold in just one sip with the delicious taste of Goldmine Premium Beer. Our beer prospectors seek out the finest quality ingredients and work hard to brew the best beer around. The news has already spread â€” drinking Goldmine is a richly rewarding experience.

Test, test

  The first beer I'm reviewing is called <p class="red">Bruwski</p>. It's a <p class="blue">stout</p>.

The next beer on our list is <p class="red">Slow Ride</p>.
It's an <p class="blue">IPA</p>.

<testdiv>How about this?</testdiv>

Now we're testing the beer called <beername>Hopdevil</beername>. It's an <type>IPA</type>. It's a strong beer with an ABV of <abv>9.8</abv>%.
